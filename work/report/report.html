            Yes, i have ben working with these techniques since my inception in
            Hkr. That is to say, from the beginning of my Software Development
            program students were in a way mandatory to work the some of thee
            techniques for example Git and GitHub. Not really but in some way I
            have practice developing a webside with few elements. I do not have
            much of experience in web application, however, my fundamental
            understanding is that there is need to learn how to use a some
            framework used for web development. Also is necessary to learn about
            HTML, CSS which are both one of the basic require knowledge. The
            structure in HTML is also key as well as the tags and elements. In
            this section i have been able to pratice more with use of terminal
            for working with git commands; how to create new file, remote
            version and tag versions.

            <h3>Answer-02</h3>
            The first assignment - A01, has marked the beginning of my
            experience of HTML and CSS but not for JavaScript. HTML in a simple
            explanation can be liken to elements or structure (skeleton) of the
            website contents. CSS Â is used to design and create a layout (in
            form of styling) for the html elements on the web pages. Today, CSS
            can also be used to create animation for the website. Javascript is
            used in similar way with CSS but with lots of other functions. Its
            ideal to use CSS instead because of it simplicity and easy way to
            apply. Javascript as mentione will help in applying logic operations
            to website for example when button is click for action to be
            performed. It is also used for transferring or submitting data
            between browser and server which is then implemented on HTML. HTTP
            is the standard application protocol that allow communication
            between the web browser and web server. Web server provides the
            contents that will be displayed on web browser. Web browser such as
            Safari, Chrome, Firefox and internet Explorer are the most popular
            and commonly used browser. These browsers get the contents from web
            server and display them according to the request from users. Things
            I learn in this section is improvement on the CSS usability and
            using grid to partition a page.

            by answering and reflecting on these questions. Write freely,

            <h3>Answer-03</h3>
            The previous 01 and 02 assignments, has improved my experience of
            HTML and CSS as well exposing me to JavaScript. I had no knowledge
            about JavaScript Client. In my opinion, JavaScript is not comparable
            or related with other language. This opinion is drawn from my
            current knowledge in certain few programming languages. Things I
            learn in this section is improvement on the CSS usability, I am able
            to applied JQuery and AJAX in in my code. Which is used for fetching
            data from Api system. I practice with querySelector that helps in
            styling HTML through .js file instead of of usig CSS. I have also
            learnt some transition of images with hover effect using some
            libraries.
