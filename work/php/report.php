            <h3>Answer</h3>
            Yes, i have ben working with these techniques since my inception in
            Hkr. That is to say, from the beginning of my Software Development
            program students were in a way mandatory to work the some of thee
            techniques for example Git and GitHub. Not really but in some way I
            have practice developing a webside with few elements. I do not have
            much of experience in web application, however, my fundamental
            understanding is that there is need to learn how to use a some
            framework used for web development. Also is necessary to learn about
            HTML, CSS which are both one of the basic require knowledge. The
            structure in HTML is also key as well as the tags and elements. In
            this section i have been able to pratice more with use of terminal
            for working with git commands; how to create new file, remote
            version and tag versions.

            <h3>Answer</h3>
            The first assignment - A01, has marked the beginning of my
            experience of HTML and CSS but not for JavaScript. HTML in a simple
            explanation can be liken to elements or structure (skeleton) of the
            website contents. CSS Â is used to design and create a layout (in
            form of styling) for the html elements on the web pages. Today, CSS
            can also be used to create animation for the website. Javascript is
            used in similar way with CSS but with lots of other functions. Its
            ideal to use CSS instead because of it simplicity and easy way to
            apply. Javascript as mentione will help in applying logic operations
            to website for example when button is click for action to be
            performed. It is also used for transferring or submitting data
            between browser and server which is then implemented on HTML. HTTP
            is the standard application protocol that allow communication
            between the web browser and web server. Web server provides the
            contents that will be displayed on web browser. Web browser such as
            Safari, Chrome, Firefox and internet Explorer are the most popular
            and commonly used browser. These browsers get the contents from web
            server and display them according to the request from users. Things
            I learn in this section is improvement on the CSS usability and
            using grid to partition a page.

            The previous 01 and 02 assignments, has improved my experience of
            HTML and CSS as well exposing me to JavaScript. I had no knowledge
            about JavaScript Client. In my opinion, JavaScript is not comparable
            or related with other language. This opinion is drawn from my
            current knowledge in certain few programming languages. Things I
            learn in this section is improvement on the CSS usability, I am able
            to applied JQuery and AJAX in in my code. Which is used for fetching
            data from Api system. I practice with querySelector that helps in
            styling HTML through .js file instead of of usig CSS. I have also
            learnt some transition of images with hover effect using some
            libraries. I aimed for the highest grade in this assignment.

            The previous 01, 02 and 03 assignments, has improved my experience of
            HTML and CSS as well exposing me to JavaScript Node.js and Express.js. 
            I do not have any previous working experience whatsoever with node/npm. 
            But it interesting to learn this from the course. 
            Running Node/npm is pretty straight forward and it easy to set up. 
            Installation is quite simple with option to run it globally or 
            just on the project/ working folder. At first I tried to separate 
            both css file and javascript file but I was getting some error issue. 
            Then i decided to have all these file created in the html file 
            which its working perfectly. And for the coding I used j
            avascript in-built Math class with the floor and random methods 
            to generate the lottery numbers. I aimed for the highest grade 
            in this assignment. I learnt about Node.js and Express.js as a 
            standard server framework with npm functionality which I agree are 
            beneficiary to know about them.

            <h3>Answer</h3>
            PHP as a programming language is easy to learn, codecontrol in 
            PHP is made easily and changing code is not difficult. 
            As an opensource it is cost efficient when building website. 
            PHP in term of performance canbe enhance because is scalable and reliable. 
            PHP is widely used and that makeit easy to find support if one run 
            into any difficulty or challenges. Itsupport all web browsers: Window, 
            MacOS, Linux or UNIX, as well as all majorweb servers such 
            Appache and Microsoft IIS and other personal web server. 
            The processing speed is fast because PHP uses it own memory 
            which does not put muchworkload on the server. 
            PHP is highly secure for example it has security 
            layerthat protect against viruses and threats. 
            PHP may not be compared with otherprogramming language 
            because it is safe to say it is a server side scriptlanguage. 
            On this course section, I used Bootstrap 4 script as 
            template forfrontend framework. Bootstrap properties were also used for hmtl; 
            body, headerand footer. With the PHP functions and implementation 
            (also through PHP globalserver on a chosing port like 8000), 
            I tried connect with both MySQL viaworkbench and phpmyadmin databases. 
            This assignement has help to betterunderstand how application 
            can be run using PHP as server in order to test theapplication 
            for efficiency and performance before launch for publicconsumption. 
            I aimed for highest grade in this assignment.

            <h3>Answer</h3>
            Programming language popularity assessment comeswith diverse 
            opinions and interest. This discussion has been around for long with 
            different perspective using different yardstick to measure the 
            popularity of all the program widely used languages. 
            I think it depend on which area ofdivide one is standing and 
            how familiar you are with any of the language. 
            We should not also forget that interest on a particular language 
            can driven by learning outcome of a particular programming language. 
            For example, as a studentin HKR we started with Java programming language, 
            and that in a way had shaped most of the studentâs opinion and interest. 
            Until we are introduced to other fewlanguages in the course of study, 
            however, the first impression feels that Java seems better 
            than most of other language. Pertinently, at this point my opinionand 
            recommendation is that Javascript is the most populous due to the 
            fact thatmore people are into web and app development if compare with 
            other programmingprofessions, and the Javascript language is less 
            complicate and easy to learn. Today,more frameworks are being develop 
            which they are made to fit and work with Javascript and this is in 
            return increasing the attention of more developer and new comers towards it. 
            Learning Javascript does not necessarily require anycoding experience and 
            this is also making it widely acceptable by many and alot of people

            authentication method so as to protect their account or system from being attack. 
            A web application can suffer broken authentication if the web application become 
            vulnerable when; it allows automated attacks like credential stuffing, 
            weak for brute force, using weak password recovery method, use weak 
            encrypted method and so on.</br>
            <h4><span class="highlight"> Sensitive data exposure:</span></h4> Is another widespread web application security challenge. 
            A lot of system users both as individual or as organization have directly or 
            indirectly, knowingly or unintentionally exposed their sensitive data some of 
            which includes; credit card details, private credential, medical information, 
            social security numbers etc., on web and this has given attackers the opportunity 
            to manipulate peoples data and give rise to identity theft.</br>
            <h4><span class="highlight"> Broken access control:</span></h4> This type of web application vulnerabilities is also a major 
            concern and challenges to especially companies. For many years, some companies allow 
            visitors to its website administrative panel and database through login page. 
            This type of implementation approach has exposed many companies to danger 
            and open up its storage to attacks.
            <h3> <span class="highlight">"Essential guidelines to follow to create secure web applications":</span></h3>
            There are certain measure that can be put in place to ensure web application security.
            Some few approaches are discussed below.
            <ul>
              <li>A multi factor authentication is a good way to strengthen account security. 
            A single authentication had been seen not to be a good method, since two-factor 
            solution is proving better and it can be made even more than two factors.
            A cross site forgery can be prevented if web developer and programmers explore 
            more of cryptographic token usage which user will use and require to re authenticate 
            before completing any form of transaction.</li>
              <li>Password change security design is another way to minimize attacks and discourage 
            attackers from attacking an account or a system. If a system is deployed with 
            identity validation and security questions by sending a generated token to user 
            via out-of-band method and requesting user to verify with enforcing a logout policy.</li>
              <li>Secure password storage will ensure to protect account from vulnerability especially 
            SQL injection and brute force. To combine several major techniques such as a one-way 
            algorithm, use a salt encryption method and to use algorithm which is purposely slow. 
            This approach can actually reduce drastically attacks on the web application.</li>
            <li>Query parameterization technique is another step that can prevent SQL injection 
            vulnerability. Developers needs to prevent untrusted input pretending as 
            statement and could be interpreted as syntax for SQL command.</li>
            </ul>
